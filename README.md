## The challenge
I tried to make a draft page where almost all the features of Scss are used. From this point of view, almost all features of scss have been tried to be used on this page.

## Problem Statement

- Your company has recently started on a project that aims to create a website with SASS and SCSS. So you and your colleagues have started to work on the project.
